<img src="https://www.escentual.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/The-History-of-DIOR-580x424.jpg">

<p>The House of Dior was established on 16 December 1946[9][5] at 30 Avenue Montaigne in Paris. However, the current Dior corporation celebrates "1947" as the opening year.[5] Dior was financially backed by wealthy businessman Marcel Boussac.[5][10] Boussac had originally invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, but Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand.[11] The new couture house became a part of "a vertically integrated textile business" already operated by Boussac.[10] Its capital was at FFr 6 million and workforce at 80 employees.[10] The company was really a vanity project for Boussac and was a "majorly owned affiliate of Boussac Saint-Freres S.A. Nevertheless, Dior was allowed a then-unusual great part in his namesake label (legal leadership, a non-controlling stake in the firm, and one-third of pretax profits) despite Boussac's reputation as a "control freak". Dior's creativity also negotiated him a good salary.[10] </p>
